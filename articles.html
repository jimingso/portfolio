            <p>You who don’t know how to pose, you who worry about getting fat on the mirror</br>
                You who make up your lipstick before taking a photo, only agree with you who take the left half of your face</br>
                You are crazy punching in every exhibition, and you laugh so much that you forget the pain of your aunt</br>
                You who don’t like looking at the camera, you who shine at night</p>

            <p>You who embrace the new love, you who want to say goodbye to the past</br>
                You who decided to go upstream, you who made big and small wishes</p>

            <p>Love is the absurdity that has been enjoyed, the wonder that has been made, the adventure that has been squandered</br>
                Love is a picture that I want to hide but can't help but show off</p>

            <p>May my shutter land on the world you want to travel around, the wings that grow out</br>
                In 2021, please let us continue our lives together</p>
